# ASCIIMAN


This is a placeholder for a planned project in the nearby future.

I used to be a Turbo Pascal coder until Windows 95 came and ruined everything that made computers good.
Now that DOSBox is there, it has been my desire for years to take out that good old Pascal compiler again, and try to create something as 'retro' as possible with it...

This project is not yet guaranteed, but I need this retro to exist while I take some preparations. 



Once the project takes shape, a few notes....
- In order to compile you need DOSBox
- This source is only meant for Turbo Pascal 7.0
- I don't think it's impossible for Free Pascal or Delphi to read this code, but I don't recommend to try unless you KNOW what you are doing :P
- It might be possible some extra frameworks that will be taken by this code as a dependency will be created, they will be linked to.
- As the compiler processing this code is a DOS application, the actual code files will all be in ALL CAPS and be 8 letters + 3 letters extension max....
