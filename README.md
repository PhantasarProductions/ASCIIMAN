# ASCIIMAN


This is a placeholder for a planned project in the nearby future.

I used to be a Turbo Pascal coder until Windows 95 came and ruined everything that made computers good.
Now that DOSBox is there, it has been my desire for years to take out that good old Pascal compiler again, and try to create something as 'retro' as possible with it...

This project is not yet guaranteed, but I need this retro to exist while I take some preparations.
